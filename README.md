# International Karate Plus


## What is this?
This is a remake of the popular game; **International Karate Plus**. Written in two days using the **daScript** scripting language, for the 2021 daScript competition at **Gaijin**.

Assets are based on the PlayStation version of the game, but music is made by [Kim Rom](https://youtu.be/Cd_9-qKuroQ).

## What is done here?
It only contains the fighting element of the game, no minigames. But it can be played by three human players.
Score is also not kept, only the number if victories, and the game also doesn't end when the player has the least amount of points in a round.
All this is due to the time constraint.

## How can it be run?
The game requires the [dasBox](https://github.com/imp5imp5/dasbox) sandbox. To make this repository self fontained, the **dasbox.exe** from [version 0.1.32](https://github.com/imp5imp5/dasbox/releases/tag/dasbox_portable_0_1_32) is included in this repository, so the game can be just started using **start.bat**.
